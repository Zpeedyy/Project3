	<p>This video showcases some video cassettes that were repurposed as jewerly. They were made in a workshop in AKC Medika, the cassetes were painted with spraypaints and then connected to metal chains. 
		<br/>All the elements within the video were mine or recolected throughout the whole semester, mixing jewerly, spraycans and posters as background the set was ready.
	<br/>The video was recorded with an iphone 13 and the lightning used was a lamp and the natural light coming from the windows.</p>
